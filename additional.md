Based on my comprehensive research, I can now provide a definitive answer about which trust deed components need to be separate documents:
✅ VERIFIED: DOCUMENTS THAT MUST BE SEPARATE FROM TRUST DEED
1. Statement of Investment Principles (SIP)
❌ SEPARATE DOCUMENT REQUIRED
The Pensions Regulator confirms: "The trustees of most schemes must draw up a written statement of investment principles (SIP). The SIP sets out the principles governing how decisions about investments must be made" ThepensionsregulatorThepensionsregulator
HOWEVER: Small schemes are exempt: "small schemes provide that they do not need: To prepare and revise a Statement of Investment Principles" Lending to Pension Schemes | Fieldfisher
2. Schedule of Contributions
❌ SEPARATE DOCUMENT REQUIRED
TPR states: "trustees must prepare schedules of contributions which show the rates and due dates of contributions payable towards a scheme during the 'relevant period'" and "The scheme actuary must certify the schedule" ThepensionsregulatorThepensionsregulator
3. Statement of Funding Principles (for DB schemes)
❌ SEPARATE DOCUMENT REQUIRED
Required under "Section 223 of the Pensions Act 2004" for defined benefit schemes Scheme funding FAQs | The Pensions Regulator
✅ SSAS SMALL SCHEME EXEMPTIONS CONFIRMED
SSAS schemes with fewer than 12 members (or 100 members) are exempt from many requirements: "The current main exemptions for small schemes provide that they do not need: To prepare and revise a Statement of Investment Principles" FieldfisherMandg
✅ DOCUMENTS THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN TRUST DEED
Based on the research, the following CAN be included within the main Trust Deed document for SSAS:
✅ Can Be Included:

 Investment policy framework - Can be basic framework in trust deed
 Normal retirement age definition - Standard trust deed provision
 Death benefit provisions - Standard trust deed provision
 Contribution limits and procedures - Basic framework in trust deed
 Amendment procedures and trustee powers - Standard trust deed provisions
 Compliance with TPR requirements - Basic compliance framework

❌ Must Be Separate (if applicable):

 Statement of Investment Principles - Only if >100 members OR DB scheme
 Schedule of Contributions - Separate certified document
 Statement of Funding Principles - Only if DB scheme

REVISED IMPLEMENTATION FOR TOZER LABS SSAS:
Since Tozer Labs SSAS will likely have <12 members, it benefits from small scheme exemptions:
✅ Single Trust Deed Document Can Include:

Investment policy framework (basic)
Retirement age provisions
Death benefit rules
Contribution procedures
Amendment powers
Trustee duties

✅ Separate Documents Still Required:

Schedule of Contributions (certified by actuary)
Any specific regulatory filings

This significantly simplifies the documentation requirement for small SSAS schemes compared to larger pension schemes.
