# COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON SUMMARY

| Approach | Timeline | Professional Cost | DIY Cost | Time Investment | Member Outcome | Recovery Rate |
|----------|----------|------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **£50k Professional** | 12-16 weeks | £4,800-8,500 | £0 | 5-10 hours | £41,500-45,200 | 83-90% |
| **£50k DIY** | 16-24 weeks | £200-800* | £550-1,350 | 43-63 hours | £48,650-49,450 | 97-99% |
| **£0 DIY** | 6-8 weeks | £0 | £25-60 | 10-17 hours | £0 | N/A |

*Emergency professional support only

## DECISION MATRIX

### Choose £50k Professional If:
- Risk-averse approach preferred
- Complex investment portfolio
- Limited time availability (5-10 hours vs 43-63 hours)
- Want optimization and warranties
- 83-90% recovery acceptable

### Choose £50k DIY If:
- Cost minimization priority
- Significant time available (43-63 hours)
- Comfortable with regulatory complexity
- Simple investment portfolio
- 97-99% recovery target
- Accept compliance risk

### Choose £0 DIY (Only Option):
- No assets to protect
- Speed is critical
- Cost minimization essential
- Nothing left to lose
- Simple process suitable for self-completion

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

**£50k Professional**: Recommended for most trustees due to complexity, risk mitigation, and reasonable cost as percentage of assets (10-17%).

**£50k DIY**: Viable for experienced trustees with significant time availability and risk tolerance. Savings of £4,000-7,000 but requires 40+ hours and accepts compliance risks.

**£0 DIY**: Only realistic option. Professional support unjustifiable when there are no assets to protect. Focus on speed and minimal cost to prevent further liabilities.

All three approaches achieve proper regulatory closure, but the risk-reward profiles are dramatically different based on assets available and trustee circumstances.
