The Key Distinction: Defined Contribution vs Defined Benefit
Most SSAS schemes are Defined Contribution schemes, where:

Benefits depend on contributions made and investment performance
A SSAP scheme will usually be a defined contribution schemes, for which the funding requirements are less onerous than those applicable to defined benefit scheme Self Administered - Irish Legal Guide

Triennial actuarial valuations are mandatory for Defined Benefit schemes, not Defined Contribution schemes.
Single Member Scheme Exemptions
For single member schemes specifically:

A single member scheme is typically put in place for the benefit of a proprietary director. That director / employee may be the principal or sole owner of the employer company Self Administered - Irish Legal Guide
The sole member must have discretion as to how the resources of the scheme are invested for the purpose of qualification as a single member scheme Self Administered - Irish Legal Guide

What This Means for You
If you're setting up a single member, defined contribution SSAS (which is the most common type), you likely do NOT need triennial actuarial valuations.
However, the document's £2,500-£5,000 triennial valuation cost suggests they may be referring to defined benefit SSAS schemes (DB SSAS), which are less common but do exist and would require actuarial valuations.
The bottom line: For a standard defined contribution SSAS (even single member), you can likely avoid the mandatory triennial actuarial valuation requirement. But you should confirm with HMRC or a pension specialist what type of scheme you're establishing, as this significantly impacts your ongoing compliance costs.
This could potentially eliminate one of the major "unavoidable" professional costs in the DIY approach.
