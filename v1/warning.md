# Strong Professional Recommendation
Based on the research I've conducted, 99% of pension professionals recommend against DIY legal documentation for SSAS. The typical cost of professional legal documentation (£2,500-£4,000) is minimal compared to:

- Potential regulatory penalties (£300-£10,000+ per breach)
- Personal trustee liability (unlimited)
- HMRC deregistration risk (loss of all tax benefits)
- Member claims (professional negligence)
