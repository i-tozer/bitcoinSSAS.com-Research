# NOTES

## HMRC takes 6 months

You cannot register with TPR unless the scheme has first registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). It can take up to six months for HMRC to complete their checks and confirm the scheme is registered with them.

## Documents That Must Be Separate From Trust Deed

### 1. Statement of Investment Principles (SIP)

**Status: SEPARATE DOCUMENT REQUIRED (with exemptions)**

The Pensions Regulator confirms: *"The trustees of most schemes must draw up a written statement of investment principles (SIP). The SIP sets out the principles governing how decisions about investments must be made"* - The Pensions Regulator

**However:** Small schemes are exempt: *"small schemes provide that they do not need: To prepare and revise a Statement of Investment Principles"* - Lending to Pension Schemes | Fieldfisher

### 2. Schedule of Contributions

**Status: SEPARATE DOCUMENT REQUIRED**

TPR states: *"trustees must prepare schedules of contributions which show the rates and due dates of contributions payable towards a scheme during the 'relevant period'"* and *"The scheme actuary must certify the schedule"* - The Pensions Regulator

### 3. Statement of Funding Principles (for DB schemes)

**Status: SEPARATE DOCUMENT REQUIRED**

Required under *"Section 223 of the Pensions Act 2004"* for defined benefit schemes - Scheme funding FAQs | The Pensions Regulator

## SSAS Small Scheme Exemptions Confirmed

SSAS schemes with fewer than 12 members (or 100 members) are exempt from many requirements: *"The current main exemptions for small schemes provide that they do not need: To prepare and revise a Statement of Investment Principles"* - Fieldfisher/Mandg

## Documents That Can Be Included in Trust Deed

Based on the research, the following **CAN** be included within the main Trust Deed document for SSAS:

### Can Be Included

- Normal retirement age definition - Standard trust deed provision
- Death benefit provisions - Standard trust deed provision
- Contribution limits and procedures - Basic framework in trust deed

## Revised Implementation for Tozer Labs SSAS

Since Tozer Labs SSAS will likely have <12 members, it benefits from small scheme exemptions:

### Single Trust Deed Document Can Include

- Investment policy framework (basic)
- Retirement age provisions
- Death benefit rules
- Contribution procedures
- Amendment powers
- Trustee duties

### Separate Documents Still Required

- Schedule of Contributions (certified by actuary)
