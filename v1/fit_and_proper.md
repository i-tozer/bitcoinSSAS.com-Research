# The "Fit and Proper" Person Test

## Key Principle

HMRC assumes that all persons appointed as scheme administrators are fit and proper persons unless HMRC holds information, or obtains information, which calls that assumption into question *PTM153000 - The scheme administrator: the fit and proper person test - HMRC internal manual - GOV.UK*.

This is good news - you start with the presumption that you ARE fit and proper unless there are specific red flags.

## Core Requirements

To be considered fit and proper, you need to demonstrate that you are:

*familiar with, and capable of competently performing, the scheme administrator's responsibilities and there is nothing in their past behaviour to suggest that they should not be responsible for the financial management of the pension scheme* - *The role of Pension Scheme Adminstrator - Talbot and Muir*.

## The Knowledge Requirement

The most relevant concern for you as a software engineer is the knowledge requirement:

*does not have sufficient working knowledge of the pensions and pensions tax legislation to be fully aware and capable of assuming the significant duties and liabilities of the scheme administrator, or does not employ an advisor with this knowledge* - *PTM153000 - The scheme administrator: the fit and proper person test - HMRC internal manual - GOV.UK*

However, there's a crucial solution: *If you are, for example, an employer setting up a pension scheme and acting as its scheme administrator, HMRC realises that you may not have a detailed knowledge of pensions and pensions tax legislation* - *Guidance on the fit and proper person criteria for pension scheme administrators - PDF Free Download*.

You can employ a qualified adviser - *Where a scheme administrator does not have a full working knowledge of the legislation, both pensions and pensions tax, they are able to employ an appropriate adviser to help them meet the fit and proper requirements* - *Focus 96 - Fit and proper persons guidance - Talbot and Muir*.

## Disqualifying Factors (Red Flags)

You would likely be considered NOT fit and proper if you have:

- been involved in tax fraud, abuse of tax repayment systems or other fraudulent behaviour including misrepresentation and/or identity theft
- a criminal conviction relating to finance, corporate bodies or dishonesty
- been the subject of adverse civil proceedings relating to finance, corporate bodies or dishonesty/misconduct
- participated in or been connected with designing and/or marketing tax avoidance schemes
- previously been the scheme administrator of, or otherwise involved with, a pension scheme which has been de-registered by HMRC
- been removed from acting as a trustee of a pension scheme by the Pensions Regulator or a Court *Densions Talbot and Muir*

## Your Situation as a 33-Year-Old Software Engineer

You would likely qualify as fit and proper IF:

- **No criminal convictions** related to finance, corporate bodies, or dishonesty
- **No involvement** in tax fraud or pension liberation schemes
- **No previous pension scheme de-registrations** by HMRC
- **No regulatory sanctions** from professional bodies
- **Willingness to engage** professional advisers for pension expertise you lack

Your age (33) is not a disqualifying factor - there are no age restrictions mentioned in the criteria.

Your profession (software engineer) is not a disqualifying factor - in fact, your technical skills could be helpful for managing the administrative systems.

## Practical Recommendation

As a software engineer, you would most likely meet the fit and proper requirements by:

1. Engaging professional advisers for pension expertise (actuaries, pension lawyers, tax specialists)
2. Demonstrating competence in the administrative and financial management aspects
3. Having a clean record with no relevant criminal convictions or regulatory issues

**Bottom line:** Your background as a software engineer with no apparent disqualifying factors should make you eligible to be considered a fit and proper person, especially if you engage appropriate professional support for pension expertise.
